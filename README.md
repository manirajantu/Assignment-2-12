# React & Axios: Assignment

## Brief

This will be familiar to you. You have worked on an assessment where you are to research and consume public APIs listed [here](https://rapidapi.com/collection/list-of-free-apis). In this assignment, you may work on the same (or different) API with React instead.

You should:
1. Study the API collection.
1. Draft a simple UI layout and component diagramming (you don't have to submit this).
1. Attempt consuming the API with React and Axios.

No code base is provided in this assessment. You are to set up the project.

## Submission Guidelines

- Cite any relevant sources consulted during your research
- Solve the problems using your own code
- Do not copy and paste solutions from the source material
- Submit your assignment to black board.
